Character Streams
Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output 
of 8-bit bytes, whereas Java Character streams are used 
to perform input and output for 16-bit unicode. Though 
there are many classes related to character streams but 
the most frequently used classes are, lesson1.FileReadTest and
FileWriter. Though internally lesson1.FileReadTest uses
FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but
here the major difference is that lesson1.FileReadTest reads two
bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.

We can re-write the above example, which makes the use of
these two classes to copy an input file (having unicode 
characters) into an output file
